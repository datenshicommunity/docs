# Register

That's because we are supporting offline and premium users, so theres an authentication that must be required.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We only allowed 1 user 1 IP Address, if you have more than one account, you will get permanent ban.
{% endhint %}

### Captcha

If you are first time join to the server you must enter captcha to verified you account isn't bot. To do that type `/captcha (`_`insert captcha here`_`)` captcha is generated automatically in chat, so read carefully and then copy the captha to your command/chat menu.
