## Donate

First of all, Thank you for supporting us, DATENSHI is non-profit organization running without sponsors and also less ads to get a live. If you want to support us, you can go to the [donation page](https://datenshi.pw/donations) to see the list of price and perks.

## Confirmation

There are a lot of players that didn't know to get the perks after donating, it's because we don't set the transaction by automatically, the transaction goes by manually, so we will give you again the how to confirm the donation.
