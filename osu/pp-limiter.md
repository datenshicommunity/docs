# PP Limiter

## Introduction

Hello! This is a guide for those who got a message from our Bot in-game. We are introducing to the public our very own unique pp limiter, this limiter’s purpose is mostly to prevent an abuser/cheater to gain more pp, additional note that **if you get messaged you are not in banned/restricted state**. You are however not allowed to gain pp anymore, meaning if you play another beatmap you will get 0pp as a result in the end of the beatmap.

## Limitation Details

{% hint style="info" %}
PP limit may change in the future without any notice depending on the staff’s discretion.
{% endhint %}

These limits also applied in Relax & Vanilla.

* Total PP
  * 5,000pp (osu!standard)
  * 8,888pp (osu!taiko)
  * 8,888pp (osu!catch)
  * 9,999pp (osu!mania)
* Per Score/Individual PP
  * Not so disclosed value.

## How can I remove the limiter?

1. You need to join our [Discord server](https://datenshi.pw/discord)
2. Link your Datenshi account with your Discord account by using our [Bot](https://osu.datenshi.pw/discordtokens). If you’re already linked, you can skip this step.
3. Before you go to text-channel `#osu-support` in the Discord, you need to assign `osu` roles in the channel `#get-roles` and then the `#osu-support` channel will be visible to yours, then press the `osu! ticket` button to open a new ticket, and wait until the bot generate new private channel.
4. Post your limitation [screenshot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/967768360811114506/967768525148139560/screenshot6618.jpg) in the channel with your `profile link` and mention (one of) our @`osu-admin` or @`community-manager` for a whitelist inquiry. Any inquiries done outside the text-channel will be ignored.

{% hint style="warning" %}
@osu-dev _**may**_ respond as well, but **please do not ping either of them directly.**

Don’t contact our staff by DM’s. Use the given channel for it.
